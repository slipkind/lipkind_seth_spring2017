### Feedback:
- Good work!
- Question 4: Need to consider the same user in different date file as one user. 
- Question 5: You may want to compare the whole list instead of the top 50 result to get the correct answer. And print top 50 words instead of the whole thing.
- Question 6: Files merging is required. Results should grouped by presidentsâ€™ name not by file name.
